title: Why I started Learning Coding at 30
---

I began college in 2003 and had originally planned on getting a CS degree. I grew up using computers and wanted to dive deeper into them. However, with the Dot Com bust just happening a couple years before (and apps weren't really a thing yet), I was told by some friends I was in the Army with who had CS degrees that there weren't any jobs for programmers. Being young and easily persuaded, I took their input to heart and changed my degree to business management.

Fast forward to 2011 when I begin working in ad tech in San Francisco, I learned how valuable programming knowledge is and kick myself for changing my degree. After then I continuously felt like I had unfinished business with programming.

After some soul-searching, I decided I would return to school and get the CS degree but then learned about coding boot camps that were beginning to increase in popularity. Since these were more cost & time efficient, I decided that this was the route I was going to take. I took some classes through General Assembly & Treehouse first to make sure programming was definitely the route I wanted to pursue and was happy with the work. I then ultimately decided on Bloc for the immersive program due to it's flexible schedule and mentorship system. I work for a great company now and did not want to take 12+ weeks off of work to take a full-time program.
